# ArduSnake
classical game of Snake implemented in arduino using led matrix and 74hc595 shiftRegisters

the objetive of this proyect is to create a portable console with this game or another classical games,
using less as possible digitalPorts of arduino,2xsifhtRegisters,2xbuttons and music. 
Why? because i want to use tiny as possible IC from arduino family.

Power  will be a 3.3V, with this voltage we can use the 8x8 led matrix without resistors, this is good because we will have less power consumption, i want to use 2AA batteries.

I will use a DC-DC to rise voltage up to 3.3V, maybe TPS61291, my objetive is: 10hours of game with 2AA batteries.

thank you for stay here reading this and be interested in mi proyect! :D
